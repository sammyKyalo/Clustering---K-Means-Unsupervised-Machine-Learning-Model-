This analysis focused on understanding and clustering programs based on various attributes, including program performance, budget, categorical variables such as region, country, and program type, and numerical variables such as efficiency and the number of program revisions. The data was preprocessed, standardized, and encoded for categorical variables. By applying K-Means clustering, we identified an optimal number of clusters based on the Gap Statistic. The results revealed distinct program clusters, each with its unique characteristics. Notably, we found programs with varying levels of performance, budget, and other attributes. This analysis offers valuable insights into program categorization and can inform strategic decisions to improve program efficiency and performance. The report concludes with recommendations for addressing specific program challenges and opportunities.
